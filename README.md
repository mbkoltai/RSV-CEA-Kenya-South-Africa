## Estimating the cost-effectiveness of maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies for respiratory syncytial virus in Kenya and South Africa

These are files to perform cost-effectiveness analysis of public health interventions against RSV disease in Kenya and South Africa, using data provided by partners in these two countries.

Data files are in the folder *custom_input*.
The main file to run the analysis to get the figures in the manuscript is *run_cea_calc_parallel.R*.
The calculations are with the previously developed R package [McMarcel](https://zenodo.org/record/3663447) that was modified to accommodate user-provided incidence data.
